## 📌 About This Challenge

I designed this challenge to master **Python for data analysis and data engineering** over 45 days — one day at a time.

You'll go from **basic syntax** to building ETL pipelines, working with big data using **PySpark**, creating dashboards with **Streamlit**, and more.

---

## 🎯 Goal

Build a solid foundation in Python with real-world experience using tools and libraries commonly used by data analysts and engineers.
