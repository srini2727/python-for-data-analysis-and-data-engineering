# ðŸ“… Day 4: Python Loops â€” `for` and `while`

Todayâ€™s focus is on using loops in Python to repeat tasks efficiently.

---

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered

- `for` loops with lists, strings, and ranges
- `while` loops
- `break` and `continue`
- Looping through dictionaries
- Nested loops
- Basic loop patterns (counting, summing, searching)

## ðŸŽ¯ Exercises

1. Print numbers 1 to 10 using a `for` loop.
2. Use a `while` loop to print numbers from 10 to 1.
3. Print all even numbers between 1 and 20.
4. Loop through a string and print each character.
5. Sum all numbers in a list.
6. Loop through a dictionary and print key-value pairs.
7. Print the multiplication table of 5.
8. Use `break` to stop a loop when a number is found.
9. Use `continue` to skip printing number 5 in a loop from 1â€“10.
10. Nested loop: print a 3x3 grid of `*` symbols.
