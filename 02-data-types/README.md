# ðŸ“… Day 2: Python Data Types & Type Casting

Todayâ€™s focus is understanding Pythonâ€™s built-in data types and how to convert between them.

---

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered

- Primitive types: `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`
- Collection types: `list`, `tuple`, `dict`, `set`
- `type()` function to inspect data
- `int()`, `float()`, `str()`, `bool()` conversions
- Mutable vs Immutable types (intro)
- Implicit vs Explicit casting

## ðŸŽ¯ Exercises

1. Create variables of type: `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`. Print each one with its type.

2. Create a list, a tuple, a dictionary, and a set â€” each with at least 3 items.

3. Convert the integer `100` to a string and concatenate it with `" is a number"`.

4. Convert string `"3.14"` into a float and multiply it by `2`.

5. Take a boolean `True`, convert it to an integer and print the result.

6. Explain the difference between a tuple and a list in a comment.

7. Convert a list to a set and print both.

8. Create a dictionary with keys: `name`, `age`, and `country`. Print them one by one.
