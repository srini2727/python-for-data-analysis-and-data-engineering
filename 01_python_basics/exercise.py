# 1. Create variables for your name, age, and country.
# Print them in a sentence using string formatting.

# 2. Take two numbers as input. Print their sum, difference, and product.

# 3. Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit. Use a variable: temperature_celsius = 30.5

# 4. Print the type of: 25, "hello", 3.14, True

# 5. Convert the string "123" to an integer and multiply by 2. Print result and type.

# 6. Ask for the user’s full name and print it in uppercase, lowercase, and title case.

# 10. Calculate area of a circle. radius = 5. Use area = π * r^2 (π = 3.14159)

# 11. Use bool() to convert and print: 0, 1, "", "hello", [], [1, 2]

# 12. Ask for a number, convert to float, and print whether it's greater than 100.
